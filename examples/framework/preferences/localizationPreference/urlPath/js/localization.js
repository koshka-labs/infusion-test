     * However, the way this example is constructed, the `langSegIndex` is at the end of the path.
     * Because we don't know ahead of time how this example will be served, we don't know the full path and must
     * dynamically calculate the index.
     *
     * @param {Object} langMap - a mapping of language code to URL path resource.
     *
     * @return {Integer} - The `lagSegIndex`. Defaults to 1 if none of the values from the langMap are found in the
     *                     current location's pathname.
